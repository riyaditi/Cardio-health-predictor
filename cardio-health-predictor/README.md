#  CardioCheck AI: Cardiovascular Health Predictor 🩺

## Project Overview

**CardioCheck AI** is a web application that leverages a machine learning model to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease based on a user's health metrics. The application provides an intuitive user interface to input health data and receive an instant risk assessment, complete with a visual gauge and personalized, non-prescriptive health recommendations.

This project was developed as an end-to-end data science application, covering everything from data cleaning and model training to deploying the model via a REST API and building a user-friendly frontend.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **📈 AI-Powered Prediction:** Utilizes a `RandomForestClassifier` trained on a dataset of 70,000 patient records to predict risk probability.
* **📊 Interactive UI:** A clean, modern, and responsive user interface for easy data input.
* ** görsel Risk Gauge:** Displays the prediction result on an animated gauge chart for immediate visual feedback.
* **❤️ Personalized Recommendations:** Generates actionable health advice based on the user's specific input data and predicted risk.
* **🚀 REST API Backend:** The model is served via a Flask API, decoupling the ML logic from the frontend.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **Machine Learning:** Pandas, Scikit-learn
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Visualization:** Gauge.js
* **Model Serialization:** Joblib

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

### **1. Prerequisites**

* Python 3.8+
* pip (Python package installer)

### **2. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/cardio-health-predictor.git](https://github.com/your-username/cardio-health-predictor.git)
cd cardio-health-predictor
````

### **3. Create a `requirements.txt` File**

It's a best practice to create a file listing all dependencies. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

*(If you haven't installed the libraries yet, create the file manually and add `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `flask`, `flask-cors`, and `joblib`)*

### **4. Install Dependencies**

Install all the necessary libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **5. Train the Model**

Run the training script to process the data and generate the `model.joblib` and `scaler.joblib` files inside the `app/` directory.

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

### **6. Run the Flask Server**

Navigate to the `app` directory and start the Flask application.

```bash
cd app
python app.py
```

The application will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

-----

## 🚀 Usage

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
2.  Fill in the health metrics in the form on the right.
3.  Click the **"Analyze My Health"** button.
4.  View your predicted risk percentage on the gauge chart and read the personalized recommendations.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

This project serves as a strong foundation. Future enhancements could include:

  * **User Authentication:** Implement user accounts (e.g., with JWT) to save prediction history.
  * **Data Persistence:** Store user data and predictions in a database like PostgreSQL or SQLite.
  * **Admin Dashboard:** Create a dashboard to monitor model performance and usage statistics.
  * **Model Retraining Pipeline:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automatically retrain and deploy the model when new data is available.
  * **Advanced Models:** Experiment with more complex models like XGBoost or a simple Neural Network to potentially improve accuracy.
